## About The Project

<p><span style="font-weight:bolder">Raising the next generation doesn't have to take the life out of you.</span> Most modern caregivers don't have access to the village support system of generations past. We created Vibrant Village so that your family can grow and thrive while surrounded by a customizable community of support.</p>
